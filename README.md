## Purpose

This repository contains solutions to various Datastructures and Algorithms questions, many taken from [Cracking the Coding interview](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0984782850).

I strongly recommend not using code found here for anything where quality matters. In many cases solutions will be sub-optimal.

My main priority when writing this code is speed; solving at the pace I'd expect to in interviews. Code should not be taken as an example of what I'd ship to production.
